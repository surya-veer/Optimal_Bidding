# Optimal_Bidding
This is problem statement of Inter IIT tech meet 2018.<br>

Consider a scenario of a gated community with many buildings requiring electricity and a solar panel plant installed along with a battery. The community decides to participate in the electricity bidding market in their region. The community also has the option of drawing from a distribution company (DISCOM) at a fixed per unit (KWh) cost. So there are four sources from which the demand can be fulfilled viz. solar plant, battery, electricity market and DISCOM.<br>

For the above defined scenario, formulate and develop an algorithm to solve the optimization problem with an objective to minimize the daily electricity bill of the community as a whole. The bid quantities and bid prices for each of the blocks are the decision variables of the optimization problem.<br>

Since bidding happens a day ahead, the actual electricity demand of the community and the actual output of the solar plant are not known exactly. So a forecast of these quantities for each of the blocks is given by an oracle at the time of bidding. A forecast of the most probable market price for each of the blocks is given by the oracle at the time of bidding.<br>
